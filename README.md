# Bench

A silly little app to benchmark iOS testing and acceptance testing frameworks, and CI configurations.

---

Bench is the playground code for the [mokacoding.com](http://mokacoding.com) posts and tutorials that take a look at different testing tools and configurations.

_I haven't decided yet what's the best way to keep this repo in order, whether with branches or folders, please **open an issue**, if you have any suggestion._
